A responsive, single-page quiz application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features a comprehensive mixed quiz covering AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks with automatic result logging and admin leaderboard.

## Features

- üß† **Comprehensive Mixed Quiz**: 12 questions covering AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- ‚úÖ **Immediate Grading**: Instant results with detailed explanations
- üìä **File-Based Storage**: Automatic result logging to JSON files
- üéØ **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators during quiz
- üîê **Input Validation**: Name required
- ‚ôø **Accessible**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation support

## Quick Start

### 1. Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd quiz-web-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

**Quiz results are automatically saved to local JSON files and displayed in the admin panel!**

### 2. Storage System

**Simple File-Based Storage** - No external services required!

- Quiz results are automatically saved to `/data/quiz-results.json`
- No setup needed - works out of the box
- Results persist between deployments on platforms that support file storage
- Admin panel reads directly from the JSON file

**How it works:**
- When someone completes a quiz, results are saved to `data/quiz-results.json`
- Admin panel fetches data from `/api/leaderboard` which reads the JSON file
- No external APIs, databases, or third-party services required

## Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended - supports serverless functions)
1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm install -g vercel

   # Deploy
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **No Environment Variables Needed!**:
   - The app uses file-based storage
   - No external service configuration required

3. **Test the Integration**:
   - Take a quiz on your deployed app
   - Check the admin panel - results should appear automatically!

### Netlify (with serverless functions)
1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. No environment variables needed!

### GitHub Pages (frontend only - no data persistence)
```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm install -g gh-pages
gh-pages -d dist
```
Note: GitHub Pages doesn't support serverless functions, so quiz results won't persist.

## File-Based Storage

The app now uses simple JSON file storage:

- **`/data/quiz-results.json`** - Stores all quiz submissions
- **Automatic creation** - File and directory created automatically on first submission
- **No setup required** - Works immediately after deployment
- **Persistent storage** - Results saved permanently (on platforms that support file persistence)

**Example quiz result entry:**
```json
{
  "id": 1634567890123.456,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-23T12:34:56Z",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "quiz": "AI & Machine Learning Knowledge Test",
  "score": 8,
  "total": 12,
  "percentage": 66.67,
  "selectedAnswers": {"1":"b","2":"c"},
  "correctAnswers": {"1":"b","2":"c"},
  "createdAt": "2025-01-23T12:34:56Z"
}
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations**:

1. **Admin panel is password-protected** - Change the default password in `/admin/login.html`
2. **File-based storage is secure** - Quiz results are stored server-side, not client-side
3. **Input validation** - All inputs are validated and sanitized on the server side
4. **No external dependencies** - No third-party services or APIs required

## Data Storage

### File Structure
```
data/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quiz-results.json    # All quiz submissions stored here
```

### Data Format
Each quiz result is stored as a JSON object:
```json
{
  "id": 1634567890123.456,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-23T12:34:56Z",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com", 
  "quiz": "AI & Machine Learning Knowledge Test",
  "score": 8,
  "total": 12,
  "percentage": 66.67,
  "selectedAnswers": {"1":"b","2":"c"},
  "correctAnswers": {"1":"b","2":"c"},
  "createdAt": "2025-01-23T12:34:56Z"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Admin Panel Access**: Make sure you're using the correct password set in `/admin/login.html`
2. **Results Not Saving**: Check that the `/data/` directory has write permissions
3. **Leaderboard Empty**: Ensure at least one quiz has been completed

### Development Mode
Run locally with `npm run dev` and test the complete flow: take a quiz ‚Üí check admin panel for results.
